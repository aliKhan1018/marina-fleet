                    <h2>The 48.2m (158.1ft) MORNING GLORY is a ketch-rigged sailing yacht delivered in 1993. The second of the celebrated 48m series to be built at the Viareggio shipyard, her steel hull and aluminium superstructure were constructed to ABS classification and designed inside and out by the yard's renowned in-house team.
                        the celebrated 48m series to be built at the Viareggio shipyard, her steel hull and aluminium
                        superstructure were constructed to ABS classification and designed inside and out by the yard's
                        renowned in-house team.</h2>
                    <p>As a motor yacht that sails, she offers both the comfort and convenience of the former and the
                        efficiency and exhilaration of the latter. She has generous and versatile deck spaces. Her
                        flybridge has a bimini awning covering the helm station and there is an L-shaped lounge to port
                        and a sofa to starboard, all with panoramic views of the cruising ground from beneath a cloud of
                        sail above. A spiral staircase around the mizzen mast leads down to the main deck.
                    </p>
                    <p>Immediately aft of the main saloon is a dining area partially shaded by the aft flybridge. Steps
                        lead up to side decks port and starboard leading to the expansive foredeck where the tenders are
                        stored on passage. Aft of the dining table is a semi-circle of seating around an oval table and
                        steps lead up either side to a raised sun lounge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Her interior showcases the many talents of Perini Navi with warm woods beautifully crafted
                        throughout. The spacious main saloon features U-shaped seating facing a working marble fireplace
                        forward. A passage to starboard leads to the forward saloon with a formal dining area to port
                        and a fully equipped sit-up bar and games table to starboard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        MORNING GLORY can accommodate eight guests in four luxurious suites. A full beam owner's suite
                        on the lower deck aft has a master study along with separate his and her bathrooms. Two double
                        cabins and two twin cabins complete the guest accommodation and she also sleep up to eight crew.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She has 990sqm (10,645sqft) of easily handled sail area delivering comfort and performance,
                        improved by her centreboard, which gives her a maximum draft of 7.7m (25.7ft) when down,
                        reducing to 3.3m (10.8ft) to allow access to off the beaten path lagoons and ports. When not
                        sailing, twin 850hp MAN diesel engines give her a top speed of 14.5 knots and a trans-oceanic
                        range of 4,900nm at 10 knots.
